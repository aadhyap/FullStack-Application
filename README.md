# FullStack-Application
This is for me to practice making a full stack application front end and backend including APIs, MongoDB, Javascript, Docker, React

This is still a work in progress. Here is an Update:

This application can search for images based on a query input and delete images. 
The backend is a Python Flask that is used to retrieve images and the frontend is in React
Both ends contain a docker file and can be run in separate containers 

Run the docker file in the backend (/API) and the docker file frontend (/images-gallery/frontend)
Go to the frontend port and play with the application!

Next Steps:
- Give users the ability to be able to save Images to database using MongoDB
