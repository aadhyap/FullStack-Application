# FullStack-Application
This is for me to practice making a full stack application front end and backend including APIs, MongoDB, Javascript, Docker, React

This is still a work in Progress Here is an Update:

This application is able to search for images based on a query input and delete images. 
The backend is a Python Flask that is used to retrieve images and the frontend is in React
Both ends contain a docker file and can be run in seperate containers 

Run the docker file in the backend (/api) and the frontend /images-gallery/frontend
Go to the frontend port and play with the application!
